Download [YuukiPS 3.0](https://github.com/ElaXan/YuukiProxy/releases/tag/3.0)

### Error
* If not show menu for Playing PS. Check for new Patch in [release](https://github.com/ElaXan/YuukiProxy/releases)

* If you have problem like "Failed to Extract il2cpp" maybe have problem with your Data Genshin Impact. You can try re download for data, if still like that. So high chance your Device is not support

* For Termux method\
Go to [AnimeGamePatch](https://github.com/ElaXan/AnimeGamePatch)

# Play
I suggest having only 1 data, not creating a new data folder to play Private Server

So just rename your data in Android/data folder <br />
rename<br />
`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`<br />to<br />`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpactzex`<br />or<br />`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpactzexo` <br />
<br />if want play official server <br />
rename<br />`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpactzex`<br />or<br />`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpactzexo`<br />to<br />`com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact`
